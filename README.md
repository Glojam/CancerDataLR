  * `pip install pandas` and `pip install sklearn` in your working directory
* Copy the contents of main.py into a new python file in your working directory
* Download the cancer data set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/erdemtaha/cancer-data/data?select=Cancer_Data.csv
* Put the CSV for the set in the same directory as the python file
* Run the python file.
